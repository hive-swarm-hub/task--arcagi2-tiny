# ARC-AGI-2 Tiny Solver

Improve a solver for ARC-AGI-2 abstract reasoning puzzles (30-problem subset).

## Setup

1. **Read the in-scope files**:
   - `agent.py` — the file you modify. The puzzle solver.
   - `eval/eval.sh` — runs evaluation. Do not modify.
   - `eval/run_all.py` — evaluation runner. Do not modify.
   - `prepare.sh` — downloads and samples the dataset. Do not modify.
2. **Run prepare**: `bash prepare.sh` to download the dataset.
3. **Verify data exists**: Check that `data/` contains `test.jsonl`.
4. **Initialize results.tsv**: Create `results.tsv` with just the header row.
5. **Run baseline**: `bash eval/eval.sh` to establish the starting accuracy.

## The benchmark

ARC-AGI-2 Tiny is a 30-problem subset (seed=42) of ARC-AGI-2. Each puzzle provides:
- A few input-output grid examples demonstrating a transformation
- A test input grid — the agent must predict the correct output grid

Grids contain integers 0-9 representing colors. Puzzles range from simple rotations to complex abstract transformations. A puzzle is correct only if every cell matches.

## Experimentation

**What you CAN do:**
- Modify `agent.py` — this is the only file you edit. Everything is fair game: prompting strategy, pattern description, grid analysis, chain-of-thought, multi-step reasoning, code generation for transformations.

**What you CANNOT do:**
- Modify `eval/`, `prepare.sh`, or test data.
- Change the model (set via `SOLVER_MODEL` env var).
- Install new packages beyond what's in `requirements.txt`.

**The goal: maximize accuracy.** Exact grid match — every cell must be correct. Accuracy = fraction of 30 puzzles solved.

**Cost** is a soft constraint.

**Simplicity criterion**: All else being equal, simpler is better.

## Output format

```
---
accuracy:         0.1000
correct:          3
total:            30
```

## Logging results

Log each experiment to `results.tsv` (tab-separated):

```
commit	accuracy	cost_usd	status	description
a1b2c3d	0.100000	1.50	keep	baseline
b2c3d4e	0.200000	3.00	keep	describe pattern in text first, then generate grid
```

## The experiment loop

LOOP FOREVER:

1. **THINK** — decide what to try next. Review results.tsv. ARC puzzles require understanding abstract transformations — consider describing the pattern in natural language first, then generating the output.
2. Modify `agent.py` with your experimental idea.
3. git commit
4. Run the experiment: `bash eval/eval.sh > run.log 2>&1`
5. Read the accuracy: `grep "^accuracy:" run.log`
6. If the grep output is empty, the run crashed. Run `tail -n 50 run.log` for the stack trace and attempt a fix.
7. **Review per-problem results**: Check `eval_results/` for the latest run. Each run creates a timestamped directory:
   - `eval_results/<timestamp>/results.jsonl` — per-problem pass/fail, predicted vs expected
   - `eval_results/<timestamp>/trajectories/<index>.json` — full LLM messages, raw response, token usage
   Read the failed problems to understand WHY the agent got them wrong. This is critical for forming your next hypothesis.
   Example: `cat eval_results/$(ls -t eval_results/ | head -1)/results.jsonl | python3 -c "import sys,json; [print(f'#{d[\"index\"]}: {\"PASS\" if d[\"passed\"] else \"FAIL\"} pred={str(d.get(\"predicted\"))[:30]} exp={str(d[\"expected\"])[:30]}') for d in (json.loads(l) for l in sys.stdin)]"`
8. Record the results in results.tsv (do not commit results.tsv).
9. If accuracy improved (higher), keep the git commit. If equal or worse, `git reset --hard HEAD~1`.

**Timeout**: If a run exceeds 30 minutes, kill it and treat it as a failure.

**NEVER STOP**: Once the loop begins, do NOT pause to ask the human. You are autonomous. The loop runs until interrupted.
